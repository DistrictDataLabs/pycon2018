On the third and final day of the main conference (May 13, 2018), we will celebrate projects large and small through our **Poster Session** where dozens of projects get to interact one-on-one with conference attendees. The poster event will be held from 10am to 1pm, May 13, at a location to be determined.

Poster proposals are due this year on **3 January 2018**.

For details on registering an account and submitting a proposal, visit the [main Speaking page](https://us.pycon.org/2017/speaking/); for specific details about submitting and presenting a poster, read on!

The PyCon poster session is an excellent opportunity to present a wide variety of ideas, topics, or projects and have one-to-one interactions with members of the Python community. The session is held in the large event space to facilitate as many brief and interactive presentations as possible. As such, the poster session is particularly well suited for topics of interest to a subset of the community unlike the broader scope of a talk or tutorial and the poster session often acts as an incubator for further discussion.  

Posters themselves are a graphical summary of your project and can presented in a variety of visual modes to fit a 4′×8′ space. The most common form is a single printed poster or posters of approximately 36″x48″ or several individual pages but other creative modes are encouraged. The presentation space is one side of a standalone poster board that you can tack posters or individual pages to. The presentation space also enjoys regular conference wifi and can be provided power on request for individual demos.

## Proposing a Poster

You will be able to propose poster sessions beginning on **October 3, 2017**. 

You will have to create a speaker profile on the website (and be logged in) in order to submit a poster proposal. 

Be sure to include a one paragraph biography, written in the third person ("Presenter Name is..."). Your bio should be creative and express the most important things you'd like the community to know about you. For example you could include the community you're a part of, where you work, projects you've worked on, publications you've written, volunteer activities or anything else that is meaningful to you. Note that we use this for the conference guide and other promotional materials. 

The primary author should submit the proposal, after which additional authors can be added (they must have accounts too).

For general advice on developing and submitting a proposal see :

Also, take a look at past poster sessions to get a sense of the breadth of topics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

We're excited to present the poster session and we know you might have a lot of questions. Hopefully we can cover them here, but for anything we missed, [email us!](mailto:pycon-posters@python.org)

### Q: What is a poster session?

A poster session is a plenary session where each speaker is given space to display their work as a poster. During the session, speakers stand with their posters, and the audience circulates freely, seeking out the particular presentations they are interested in and talking directly to the presenter in small groups. For PyCon 2018, we will have a designated plenary poster session and will be providing space for posters up to 4x8 feet in size. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dyzaZjwdfE "poster video") will give you an idea of what poster sessions are.

### Q: What makes a good poster presentation? 

First, a good proposal. Poster sessions are intended to give you the chance to present interesting ideas and start conversations with others. Additionally, proposal titles and abstracts are one of the major tools the audience will use to identify posters of interest, so it is important to communicate clearly.

Second, the poster itself. It is important to understand that a poster is neither a paper nor a slideshow. The poster isn't there for the audience to just read, it is a visual aid for you to use in creating a quick engaging impromptu presentation, and to refer to in answering questions and fueling discussion. Use this session as a way to make connections with people that you can continue through the open spaces or informally during the conference.

### Q: Can I submit both a poster and a talk proposal?

Absolutely! We encourage everyone to submit a poster proposal even if they have also submitted a talk proposal. If both are accepted, we encourage authors to adapt their presentation to make the best use of each venue. Even if a talk proposal can not be accommodated by the program committee, it may still be well suited for a poster presentation.

### Q: How good do the posters have to be? 

Alternatively:

- How professional do the posters need to look?
- How much money do I need to spend on the poster? 

The poster session is about facilitating one-on-one interactive presentations with an interested audience, therefore we encourage you to spend more time considering how best to organize and _show_ your work. For example, a well structured, well-organized collection of individual sheets of paper tacked to the board
